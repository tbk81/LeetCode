https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],
                [4,5,6],
                [7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],
        [8,5,2],
        [9,6,3]]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],
                [2,4,8,10],
                [13,3,6,7],
                [15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],
        [14,3,4,1],
        [12,6,8,9],
        [16,7,10,11]]
